# interactive-rating page 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Desktop-first workflow

This is my first ever project using Javascript material I've acquired so far, mostly DOM. I told myself that i'd build with the mobile first design workflow for my future projects, but, the design for this page is not that different between mobile and desktop so that's my excuse....
